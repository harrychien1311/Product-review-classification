# Product-review-classification
1 Summary of the project:

In this project, I build a LSTM-based sentiment classification model to classify custormer's behaviour buying clothes and jewerly in the Amazon website based on their reviews of ordered products leaving on the website. The model's output is a 3-class output which are postivie, negative and neutral. This project uses a pretrained word2vec model which is Google Word2Vec model to embed sentences into word embedding vectors. Then the LSTM model will use these embedding vectors to train the model. 


2 The goal of the project:
This project will help the producers can control and understand their custormer behavior to improve their products.

3 Desied ouputs:

The custormer's behavior:
Positive: Really like the product
Negative: Really hate the product
Neutral: Feel the product not too good but not bad
